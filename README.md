# Predicting Air Quality Levels Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict air quality index (AQI) levels based on environmental data. It supports better understanding and monitoring of pollution, enabling proactive environmental strategies.

## Objectives
- Predict AQI based on multiple air pollutant and meteorological features.
- Compare ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression).
- Visualize air quality trends and feature influences.
- Aid environmental policy-making and public health safety.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Dataset
Sample environmental data including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, temperature, humidity.

## How to Run
1. Load the dataset.
2. Run source_code.py to train and evaluate models.
3. View visualizations and prediction outputs.
